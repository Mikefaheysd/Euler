/*Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*/

import java.util.*;
public class Test {
	public static void main(String args[]){
		int sum = 0;
		int fibo1=1, fibo2=1, fibonacci=1;
		while(fibonacci<=4000000){
			fibonacci = fibo1 + fibo2; //Fibonacci number is sum of previous two Fibonacci number
			fibo1 = fibo2;
			fibo2 = fibonacci;
			if(fibonacci % 2 == 0)
				sum+=fibonacci;
		}
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}
